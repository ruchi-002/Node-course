I am glad to welcome you on my website devoted to traveling. My name is Uliana, I am 30 years old and as you may guess I am fond of exploring this big and incredible world. I was born in Kiev, Ukraine and I am living and working there between my travels. I am sorry for my English which is far away from perfect, but I hope it will not disturb you much and you will find my articles and stories interesting and informative
